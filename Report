Report: Results of the Initial Jenkins Pipeline Run
1. Pipeline Overview
Pipeline Name: Java Application CI/CD Pipeline
Objective: Automate the build, test, and deployment process while ensuring code quality, test coverage, and security compliance.

2. Pipeline Stages
The Jenkins pipeline consisted of the following stages:

Checkout Code: Pulled the latest code from the Git repository.
Build and Test: Compiled the code and executed unit tests using Maven.
Code Quality Check: Analyzed code quality using SonarQube.
Code Coverage: Measured test coverage using JaCoCo.
Cyclomatic Complexity: Calculated code complexity using PMD or a similar tool.
Security Scan: Scanned for vulnerabilities using OWASP Dependency-Check.
3. Results Summary
Stage	Status	Key Observations
Checkout Code	✅ Successful	Code successfully pulled from the repository.
Build and Test	✅ Successful	All unit tests passed with a success rate of 100%.
Code Quality Check	✅ Successful	SonarQube quality gates met.
Code Coverage	✅ Successful	Achieved 85% coverage, exceeding the 80% threshold.
Cyclomatic Complexity	✅ Successful	Complexity within acceptable range; no method exceeded threshold.
Security Scan	❌ Failed	Found 2 critical vulnerabilities requiring immediate attention.
4. Tool Dashboards and Screenshots
Here’s a summary of the results with screenshots from each tool:

Methods with High Complexity: 0

4.5 OWASP Dependency-Check Report
Description: Found 2 critical vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
Key Metrics:
Critical Vulnerabilities: 2
High Vulnerabilities: 3


5. Conclusion
The initial pipeline run demonstrated the effectiveness of the Jenkins CI/CD setup. The integration of SonarQube, JaCoCo, and OWASP Dependency-Check ensures high-quality, secure code. The next steps involve resolving vulnerabilities and iterating to improve test coverage.
